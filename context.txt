Here's a detailed summary of our conversation:

You initially described transitioning from a minesweeper game using PDAs (Program Derived Addresses) for user deposits to a system where users can connect their browser wallets directly for deposits and withdrawals.
We discussed three implementation options:

Option 1: Full smart contract approach with on-chain state tracking
Option 2: Backend database + contract verification (hybrid approach)
Option 3: Smart contract for deposits with off-chain tracking and batch withdrawals


You preferred Option 2, and we discussed whether to integrate this new functionality into your existing codebase or create a separate module.
I recommended creating a new module within your workspace to maintain clean separation of concerns between the PDA-based system and direct wallet system.
You asked for naming suggestions for the new module, and I suggested options like "direct-wallet" or "browser-wallet".
You mentioned having a Rust backend and asked about SDKs for Ethereum withdrawals. I recommended ethers-rs.
You pointed out that ethers-rs has been rewritten as Alloy, and asked for an example of how to transfer funds between users using Alloy.
I provided a code example using Alloy to transfer funds from one address to another.
You asked about database schema changes to support the new functionality, sharing your existing schema with User, Wallet, Transaction, and Pnl models.
I recommended extending your existing schema rather than creating a new database, with changes like adding wallet_type and wallet_address to support both PDA and direct wallets.
You asked about tracking database changes over time for better record-keeping.
I discussed various database migration approaches, including schema migration tools like SQLx Migrate and audit tables.
You clarified that you wanted to know how production codebases track database changes, and I explained how migration frameworks like SQLx Migrations and Diesel Migrations are used in production environments to timestamp and track changes.

The main technical decision was to implement a hybrid approach (Option 2) where you maintain user balances in your backend database while using smart contracts for deposits/withdrawals, extending your existing database schema to support both wallet types.
